            <p>We scraped the data out of MIT's official course catalogue. Because the course 
                catalogue's HTML is extremely ill-formed, our data extraction code makes 
                mistakes sometimes.
            </p>
            <p><a href="mailto:course-picker@lists.csail.mit.edu?subject=Data Error">E-mail us</a> about errors you find.
                We'll try our best to fix it. But we're students just like yourself so we're
                also very busy at the beginning of the term. Please be patient.
            </p>
            <p>Please be as specific as possible about the errors you find! Tell us the 
                course numbers, the sections, the instructors&mdash;as much information as 
                possible to help us locate the errors quickly.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you. We appreciate all the help we can get!
