                <li><b>How do I make several potential schedules?</b>
                    <p>Just open this course picker in several browser windows or tabs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Why can I not select some courses?</b>
                    <p>We couldn't scrape all the data for all courses. You can help us scrape
                        the data out of the official course catalogue and we'll incorporate that
                        data into this application. Yes, you can help ease the pain of thousands
                        of students. <a href="mailto:course-picker@lists.csail.mit.edu">Let us know</a>
                        if you want to help and we'll tell you how.

                <li><b>Who made this course picker?</b>
                    <p>Several undergrad students and grad students who can't stand the official 
                        course catalogue. If you can't stand it either, 
                        <a href="mailto:course-picker@lists.csail.mit.edu">let us know</a> and maybe
                        MIT will hear our voice together. Otherwise, the official course catalogue
                        will probably look the same after another decade.

                <li><b>How does this course picker work?</b>
                    <p>It consists of a bunch of <a href="data/">JSON files</a> that store data and some Javascript
                        code that builds the user interface on the fly in your browser. There
                        is no back-end database or back-end web application. The Javascript code is
                        mostly in the 
                        <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/exhibit/">Exhibit</a> and
                        <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timegrid/">Timegrid</a> APIs.
