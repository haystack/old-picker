The connections between theory and practice are realized in the design exercises. Required design reviews precede the LTA race competition. The performance, weight, and principle characteristics of the LTA vehicles are estimated and illustrated using physics, mathematics, and chemistry known to freshmen, the emphasis being on the application of this knowledge to aerospace engineering and design rather than on exposure to new science and mathematics.
