Offered under the auspices of the Joint Center for Geoscience of MIT and the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. Part of subject taught at Goddard where students participate in tours of laboratories to observe sensor development in progress, mission operations facilities to view real-time data collection, and computational facilities to participate in data processing and analysis.
