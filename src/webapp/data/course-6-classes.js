Designed as more conceptual and less technical (mathematical). That is, use of mathematics (sometimes sophisticated) is taught but the detailed proofs are usually omitted. Concepts supported and explained with examples drawn from the Internet. Provides the necessary background for advanced subjects on foundations of engineering systems.",
