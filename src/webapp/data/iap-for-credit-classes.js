This week-long intro to MATLAB will cover the basics of the MATLAB user interface and programming language. Through instructor presentations and daily problem sets you will learn about MATLAB syntax, general programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements, and how to analyze and visualize data in MATLAB. By no means is the class comprehensive; however we do hope that you will build skills and confidence with the programming enough to learn more on your own as necessary for other classes at MIT or lab work as a UROP."

The robots are not autonomous; teams will be provided with wireless controllers to command their robots. The challenge is to produce the fastest running gaits and the deadliest fighting motions to compete against the other robots at a deathmatch.  Presentations provide brief reviews of the state of the art in humanoid robot control techniques, much like those of Honda\'s Asimo."

This week-long intro to MATLAB will cover the basics of the MATLAB user interface and programming language. Through instructor presentations and daily problem sets you will learn about MATLAB syntax, general programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements, and how to analyze and visualize data in MATLAB. By no means is the class comprehensive; however we do hope that you will build skills and confidence with the programming enough to learn more on your own as necessary for other classes at MIT or lab work as a UROP."

The problem may be prototypical or a particular aspect of a whole project, but always interdisciplinary in nature. While prevention strategies are contested on the global political stage, the effects of climate change are already in motion. Rising ocean levels will transform landscapes and displace millions of people. In this three-week design research workshop, we will document and analyze five different grounds, each of which posits a different adaptive response to climate change-related flooding: Accumulate: raised ground, Drift: floating ground, Relocate: refugee ground, Loft: suspended ground, Harbor: protected ground. We will study how these five topographies of floodspace operate on the deltaic plains of Bangladesh. Our aim is to create a set of online visual essays that identify challenges and opportunities in proposing new ways to think about and design for floodspace habitation. Attendance at Nov. 20 informational meeting advised."
