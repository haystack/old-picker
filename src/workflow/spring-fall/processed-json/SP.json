{"items":[{"has-final":false,"semester":"Summer","description":"A seven-week academic skills-honing program, Interphase is designed to enhance the preparedness of students entering MIT in the fall semester. The program has a dual focus: academic readiness and general educational development. The program involves calculus, chemistry, physical education, physics, writing, and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. The students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal and educational development seminars and activities designed to ensure their smooth transition to college life. The summer experience gives them increased opportunity to prepare for the rigors of an MIT full-subject load.","label":"Interphase","type":"Class","course":"SP","units":"Unknown","in-charge":"Reid, K.

Students meet in study groups of five to six participants with facilitators trained in effective classroom techniques and concept focus. The study groups help students to reinforce concepts learned in the regular curriculum, and help them to gain mastery of concepts and problems that are often more challenging than those dealt with during lecture. The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students\' understanding of MIT\'s academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students\' schedules.","label":"Program XL: You Can Be a Success at MIT","type":"Class","course":"SEM","units":"Unknown","in-charge":"Mtingwa, S.","joint":false,"offering":"Currently Offered","id":"SEM.XL1","area":"Seminar XL","listing-index":"mSPa-001","level":"Undergrad","url":"http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mSPa.html#SEM.XL1","total-units":"Unknown"},{"has-final":false,"semester":["Fall","Spring"],"description":"An innovative and personalized program for  first-year students who wish to take a more active role in their MIT education.
