{"items":[{"has-final":false,"semester":"Summer","description":"A seven-week academic skills-honing program, Interphase is designed to enhance the preparedness of students entering MIT in the fall semester. The program has a dual focus: academic readiness and general educational development. The program involves calculus, chemistry, physical education, physics, writing, and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. The students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal and educational development seminars and activities designed to ensure their smooth transition to college life. The summer experience gives them increased opportunity to prepare for the rigors of an MIT full-subject load.","label":"SP.100 - Interphase","type":"Class","course":"SP","units":"Unknown","in-charge":"Reid, K.
