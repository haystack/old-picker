The large number of sites, combined with the fact that a majority of these properties are located in urban and historically underserved communities, dictate that redevelopment of these sites stands to be a common challenge to urban planners for the foreseeable future. Students develop a grounded understanding of the brownfield lifecycle: how and why they were created, their potential role in community revitalization, the role of community-based organizations in spurring their redevelopment, and the general processes governing their redevelopment. Using case studies, field projects, and guest speakers from the public, private and non-profit sectors, students develop and hone skills to effectively address the problems posed by these inactive sites.","category":"H-LEVEL Grad Credit","units":"4-0-8","id":"11.370","offering":"Currently Offered","label":"Brownfields Policy and Practice","total-units":"12.0","url":"http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m11c.html#11.370","in-charge":"Hamilton, J.","subarea":"Program Group Subjects","type":"Class","prereq":"11.601","course":"11","listing-index":"m11c-039","level":"Grad"},{"joint":true,"has-final":false,"semester":"Spring","description":"Assessment of current and potential energy systems, covering extraction, conversion and end-use, with emphasis on meeting regional and global energy needs in the 21st century in a sustainable manner.
