Topics include review of probability and statistics, estimation and testing of linear regression models, theory of individual choice behavior, derivation, estimation, and testing of discrete choice models (including logit, nested logit, GEV, probit, and mixture models), estimation under various sample designs and data collection methods (including revealed and stated preferences), sampling, aggregate forecasting methods, and iterative proportional fitting and related methods. Lectures reinforced with case studies, which require specification, estimation, testing, and analysis of models using data sets from actual applications.","level":"High Graduate","prereqs":"Permission of instructor","grading":"Letter graded","repeatable":"Not repeatable for credit","ci":"","gir":"","joint":"1.202J","equivalent":"","semester":['Spring'],"offering":"Currently Offered","in-charge":"M.
