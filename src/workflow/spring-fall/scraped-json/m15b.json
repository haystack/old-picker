            "description":   "Provides concepts and frameworks for understanding the potential impact of information technology (IT) on business performance. Examines how some firms make IT a strategic asset while other firms struggle to realize value from IT investments. Focuses on the business value of IT rather than the technology itself, and explores the roles of both general managers and IT executives in using IT to achieve operational excellence and business agility. Topics include business operating models; IT investment and prioritization; business strategy and IT alignment; IT?s architecture and governance, and the role of the IT unit. Draws heavily on research and case studies from MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research. Restricted to graduate students.",

With the establishment of the World Trade Organization implementing the GATT, NAFTA, and other trading regimes, serious questions have been raised concerning the effects of global trade on sustainability, which must be viewed broadly to include not only a healthy economic base, but also a sound environment, stable employment, adequate purchasing power, distributional equity, national self-reliance, and maintenance of cultural integrity. Subject explores the many dimensions of sustainability and the use of national, multinational, and international political and legal mechanisms to further sustainable development.",
