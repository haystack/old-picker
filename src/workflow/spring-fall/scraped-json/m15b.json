The second goal is to provide an introduction to the main groups that together form the Behavioral Policy Sciences (BPS) area of MIT/Sloan. In addition to Economic Sociology, these groups are Organization Studies, Work and Employment, Strategic Management, Global Management, and Technology, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. Primarily for first-year doctoral students in BPS.
