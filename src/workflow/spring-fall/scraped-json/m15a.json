Methods for integrating decision analysis and option pricing using financial market information are illustrated with applications to a wide variety of cases, such as valuing start-ups, valuing manufacturing flexibility, valuing new technologies, valuing oil and gas exploration, and development options.

Several complex team negotiations follow. Grades depend solely on effective negotiation with class counterparts. Students must complete all negotiation exercises in order to receive a grade.

Subject enables healthcare managers to ask the important questions surrounding a decision to pursue a clinical trial. Deciding to participate in a clinical trial can sometimes result in expensive, long-term corporate commitments, which can have a significant impact on the company's success or failure, particularly in the case of smaller companies. Subject explores issues related to determing whether a clinical trial is needed to significantly further the important goals of the company. Topics include the design, implementation, analysis and presentation of clinical trials. Case scenarios are presented by professionals in the field, and students are asked to develop their own Outline Plan and Clinical Trial Study Plan from the sample cases provided.

            "description":   "As markets or production bases, China and India are becoming important and integral players in the global economy. Foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investments and outsourcing businesses have increased dramatically in these two economies. Despite the rising importance of these two economies on the world stage, our knowledge and analysis of these two countries in an integrated manner has remained poor. The two are often lumped together by business analysts as ?emerging markets,? despite the substantial differences in their political systems, reform policies and business organizations. Academics, in contrast, have tended to treat two countries separately, preferring to specialize in issues and questions specific to one or the other country. The purpose of this course is to analyze these two countries within a coherent analytical framework. Our learning model is inductive, and heavily based on class discussions and participation. The group projects should aim at integrating analysis, knowledge and understanding of these two countries. We will also experiment with other forms of group projects, such as creating and working on business plans and those projects that integrate research from field trips with more traditional research(such as library research). There is no prerequisite but 15.012 and 15.223 are highly recommended. Half term course.",
