            "description":   "All three subjects cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material, described below. The core material focuses on function at a molecular level: the structure and regulation of genes, and the structure and synthesis of proteins; how these molecules are integrated into cells; how cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms; and computational and genomic approaches to biology. 7.012 and 7.013 are similar, as both emphasize current issues in human biology. 7.012 focuses slightly more on genetic approaches, 7.013 on development and neurobiology. Fall Term: 7.012. Exploration into areas of current research in cell biology, immunology, neurobiology, human genetics, developmental biology, and evolution. Spring Term: 7.013. Application of the fundamental principles toward an understanding of human biology. Topics include genetics, cell biology, molecular biology, disease (infectious agents, inherited diseases and cancer), developmental biology, neurobiology and evolution. Spring Term: 7.014. Application of the fundamental principles toward an understanding of microorganisms as geochemical agents responsible for the evolution and renewal of the biosphere and of their role in human health and disease. Topics include biogeochemical cycles; population growth; ecosystem ecology; microbial diversity.",

Discussion of crystallographic theory is complemented with exercises such as crystallization, data processing, and model building. In the second half of the course, biophysical techniques are covered that supplement the 3-D characterization of biological macromolecules. Topics include CD spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Theoretical principles behind the techniques are covered, applications are discussed, and students are performing practical exercises using instrumentation available at MIT.",
