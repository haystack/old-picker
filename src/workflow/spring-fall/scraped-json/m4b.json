Students are asked to consider particular subjects or narratives to work with as source material for experiments in the transforming of an idea into visual form. Video functions as a basic tool while questions of perception in relation to sound and image and how they are altered by various devices are explored. Students make props or objects that embody aspects of their narratives to use in relation to movement and space. Assignments during the workshops lead to a final performance project.",
