Compares period thinking to present-day debates about the scientific method, art, religion, and society. This team-taught, interdisciplinary subject draws on a wide range of literary, dramatic, historical, and  scientific texts and images, and involves theatrical experimentation as well as reading, writing, researching and conversing. Meets most of the time with 21L.016, but differs from it by analyzing theatrical texts.",
