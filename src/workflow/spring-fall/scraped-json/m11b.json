Students then develop their own simulations and games, study what and how others learn from them (including field testing of products), and how games and simulations can be implemented in educational settings. All levels of computer experience welcome. Graduate students are expected to complete additional assignments.",

Seeks to understand organizational processes and outcomes in the surrounding economic, cultural, and institutional context in which they are situated. The second goal is to provide an introduction to the main groups that together form the Behavioral Policy Sciences (BPS) area of MIT/Sloan. In addition to Economic Sociology, these groups are Organization Studies, Work and Employment, Strategic Management, Global Management, and Technology, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. Primarily for first-year doctoral students in BPS. Subject consists of four modules that are taught by faculty from each of the four BPS groups, as well as integrative sessions taught by the main instructor.",
