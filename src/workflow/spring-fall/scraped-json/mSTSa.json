Treats the emergence of industrial capitalism: the rise of the factory system; new forms of power, transport, and communication; the advent of the large industrial corporation; the social relations of production; and the hallmarks of science-based industry. Views technology as part of the larger culture and reveals innovation as a process consisting of a range of possibilities that are chosen or rejected according to the social criteria of the time.",

Contexts range from 19th century factories to 21st century techno dance floors, from hospitals to biotech firms, from colonial Melanesia to capitalist Massachusetts. Discussions organized around three questions: What cultural effects and risks follow from treating biology as technology; how have computers changed the way we think about ourselves; and how are politics built into our infrastructures?",
