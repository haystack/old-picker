Emphasis on transportation-oriented examples. Introduces the CLIOS process, defining the concept and distinguishing between quantitative and qualitative analyses of such systems. Systems characterized, measures of system performance developed, and key CLIOS system concepts (including sustainability, equity, mobility, and accessibility) introduced. Class-wide project, with students working in teams on the design of a CLIOS system, taking a broad systems perspective in that design. Examples include the urban ring, a proposed new transit line for Boston; Tren Urbano in San Juan, Puerto Rico; the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project in Boston; and the transportation of spent nuclear fuel.",

This course will investigate techniques from control theory and optimization that help develop and manage these systems. Although each system has unique features that need to be understood, we will see how some tools have general applicability. The course will study concepts such as stability, robustness, resource allocation, stakeholder equity, and arguments for centralization/decentralization of components.",
