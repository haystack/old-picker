An Anigraf makes explicit how one agent's knowledge is related to another's, and how the form of these relationships affect the social choice. Simulations are used to discover emergent properties of different Anigraf models. Topics include elementary graph theory, network designs, partial orders, voting strategies, coordination games, and dynamics of choice. Applied examples taken from insect societies, neural networks, studies of co-evolution, cognition, and group decision-making.",
