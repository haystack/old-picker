Examines foraging and feeding, defensive and aggressive behavior, courtship and reproduction, migration and navigation, and various social activities and communication.  Students consider the contributions of inherited patterns and cognitive abilities as well as the roles of various types of plasticity. Both field and laboratory studies are reviewed; human behavior is considered in the context of primate studies.",
