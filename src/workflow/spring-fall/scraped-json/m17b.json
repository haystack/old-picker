            "description":   "While this seminar provides an overview of recent literature, its principal purpose is to help graduate students develop skills suited to production of research papers and/or dissertations. Begins by reviewing general theoretical and methodological issues, then turns to specific empirical studies that examine the effects of systems structure, national attributes, bargaining processes, institutions, ideas, and norms on security affairs and political economy. The last two sessions of the seminar are devoted to evaluating research proposals generated by all members of the class.",
