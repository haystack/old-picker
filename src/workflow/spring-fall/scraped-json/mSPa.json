            "description":   "A seven-week academic skills-honing program, Interphase is designed to enhance the preparedness of students entering MIT in the fall semester. The program has a dual focus: academic readiness and general educational development. The program involves calculus, chemistry, physical education, physics, writing, and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. The students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal and educational development seminars and activities designed to ensure their smooth transition to college life. The summer experience gives them increased opportunity to prepare for the rigors of an MIT full-subject load.",

            "description":   "An academic enrichment program for first-year students, XL utilizes the innovative and effective small-group learning concept to enhance students' academic performance in calculus and science. Students meet in study groups of five to six participants with facilitators trained in effective classroom techniques and concept focus. The study groups help students to reinforce concepts learned in the regular curriculum, and help them to gain mastery of concepts and problems that are often more challenging than those dealt with during lecture. The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.",

In place of lectures and large classes, ESG students take their core subjects through small interactive classes, seminars, and independent study projects, with opportunity for more flexibility in pace and scheduling than is normally available in the regular curriculum. Credit is available in freshman subjects in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics, as well as several HASS, HASS-D, and CI-H offerings. Certain sophomore-level subjects can be studied in ESG, depending on staff and student interest. Undergraduate seminars in a variety of areas are also offered, including psychology, music, robotics, and creative writing. Students are expected to take the majority of their classes in ESG but may take one or two classes in the regular curriculum. Staff includes MIT faculty, lecturers, graduate students, and undergraduate instructors who are interested in teaching in a small and informal academic community.",

Review of student work will be interspersed with chalk talks and slide and print demonstrations on topics such as aliasing, modes and formats, image compression, and halftone and dye sublimation printing. Each student will be expected to produce a duplicate set of black and white and/or color prints as the project output: one to keep and one for display at the Center.",
