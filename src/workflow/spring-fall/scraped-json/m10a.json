Emphasis on materials and processes commonly used for fabrication for MEMS and not microelectronic systems. Discussion of the processing and properties of both thin and thick polycrystalline and amorphous films, wafer and thin film bonding, bulk micromachining techniques, and the relationships between processing and properties of active materials such as piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics and phase-transition materials. Key material properties and parameters and their relationships with microfabrication processes and applications are discussed, including elastic and inelastic deformation, fracture, residual stress, fatigue, creep, adhesion, stiction, and coupled-field constitutive behavior. Materials and process selection and case studies of applications provide a unifying theme.",
