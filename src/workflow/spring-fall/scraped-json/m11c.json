Recent developments (globalization, liberalization, privatization) have created a mix of opportunities and risks for labor in most developing countries. On the one hand, these trends have encouraged foreign direct investment and the diffusion of global supply chains, which in turn, have promoted economic development and job growth for some groups of workers in some of these countries. On the other hand, globalization and liberalization have undermined social safety nets, eroded labor and environmental standards, and resulted in greater rates of poverty for other groups of workers in other developing countries. How do we explain these differences? What kinds of policies can be promoted to more evenly distribute the benefits of globalization? Subject seeks to address these two questions.",

Investigates the role of government regulation, green business and transportation policy as a facilitator of economic development and environmental sustainability. Analyzes a variety of international policy problems including government-business relations, the role of interest groups, non-governmental organizations, and the public and media in the regulation of the automobile; sustainable development; global warming; politics of risk and siting of transport facilities; environmental justice; equity; as well as transportation and public health in the urban metropolis. Provides students with an opportunity to apply transportation and planning methods to develop policy alternatives in the context of environmental politics.",

Consists of three parts: The Environmental Policy Debates, Environmental Planning Techniques and Strategies, and Synthesis and Preparation for Practice. The first part revolves around debate-style presentations in which student teams test contrary arguments drawing on the relevant philosophical literature. The second part provides an overview of techniques and strategies for environmental management and planning. The third part introduces students to EPP faculty work and helps students formulate a plan for the remainder of their graduate studies.",
