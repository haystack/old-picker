Explores the many ways in which geologic processes control and modify the Earth's environment. Topics include chemical and physical interactions between the solid Earth, its oceans and atmosphere; the effect of catastrophic events such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes on the environment; geologic hazards; and our role in modifying the environment through Earth resource development. Serves as an introduction to 12.120, which addresses field applications of these principles in the American Southwest.",

For example, students can develop the geophysical modeling of the results or synthesis of the results into other studies in the area. The final written and oral reports from the students are structured so that they can be combined into a comprehensive report of the field camp and its results.
