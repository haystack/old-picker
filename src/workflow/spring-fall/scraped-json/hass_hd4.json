Examines these activities and the forces that shaped them, drawing on case studies in contrasting environmental settings from the Near East and Mesoamerica. In laboratory sessions, students learn to manage various classes of archaeological data and analyze archaeological artifacts made from materials such as stone, bone, and ceramics. These analyses help reconstruct the past.",
