Topics include review of the many communication styles prevalent in the field; strategies for tailoring reports, technical papers, and presentations for specific audiences; and mechanics of organization and style. Weekly assignments in writing or speaking with peer and instructor feedback. Students are expected to develop and publicly defend a research proposal as part of the subject. For Geosystems students, this proposal anticipates the thesis required for completion of the SM degree program.",

Offered under the auspices of the Joint Center for Geoscience of MIT and the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. Part of subject taught at Goddard where students participate in tours of laboratories to observe sensor development in progress, mission operations facilities to view real-time data collection, and computational facilities to participate in data processing and analysis.
