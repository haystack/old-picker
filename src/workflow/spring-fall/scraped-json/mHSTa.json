Topics include the principles underlying strategies for employing selected exogenous cells, biomaterial scaffolds, soluble regulators or their genes, and mechanical loading for the regeneration of tissues and organs in vitro and in vivo. Differentiated cell types and stem cells are compared and contrasted for this application, as are natural and synthetic scaffolds. The rationale for employing selected growth factors is covered and the methods for incorporating their genes into the scaffolds are examined. Discussion addresses the influence of environmental factors including mechanical loading and culture conditions. Methods for fabricating tissue-engineered products and devices for implantation are taught. Examples of procedures currently employed clinically are analyzed as case studies.",
